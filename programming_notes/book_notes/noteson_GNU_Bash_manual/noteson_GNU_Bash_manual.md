# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 What is Bash?

> "Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system."

## 1.2 What is a shell?

> "At its base, a shell is simply a macro processor that executes commands. The term macro processor means functionality where text and symbols are expanded to create larger expressions."

> "A Unix shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language."

> "Shells also provide a small set of built-in commands (builtins) implementing functionality impossible or inconvenient to obtain via separate utilities. For example, `cd`, `break`, `continue`, and `exec` cannot be implemented outside of the shell because they directly manipulate the shell itself. The `history`, `getopts`, `kill`, or `pwd` builtins, among others, could be implemented in separate utilities, but they are more convenient to use as builtin commands."

# 2 Definitions

- exit status
  * > The value returned by a command to its caller. The value is restricted to eight bits, so the maximum value is 255.
- metacharacter
  * > A character that, when unquoted, separates words. A metacharacter is a space, tab, newline, or one of the following characters: ‘|’, ‘&’, ‘;’, ‘(’, ‘)’, ‘<’, or ‘>’.
- return status
