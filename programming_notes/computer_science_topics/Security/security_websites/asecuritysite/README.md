Elliptic Curve Types and nG https://asecuritysite.com/ecc/ecc_types
- > We have a number of possible types of elliptic curve methods. These have a `field` (the prime number used), the `order` (the number of elliptic curve points), an `a` value, a `b` value, and a generator point (`G`). For a ***`Weierstrass curve`*** the standard form is $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$. With a ***`twisted Edwards curve`*** (such as `Ed25519`) we have the form of $ax^2 + y^2 = 1 + dx^2y^2$. A ***`Montgomory curve`*** has the form of $by^2 = x^3 + ax^2 + x$.
