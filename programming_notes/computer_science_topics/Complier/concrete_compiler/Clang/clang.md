## Clang 发音

>> //notes：总结一下就是，正确的发音就是 `klang`。原因包括如下几点：
```console
1. 官方认可的，在邮件列表里有人问发音的事，有回答是 `klang`。
2. 项目创始人在 youtube 视频里有 `klang` 的发音。
3. 如果发音为 c-lang，那么容易让人分不清是说这个编译器，还是 C 语言。且大概率容易让人误解是在说 C 语言。
4. clang 本身是一个英文单词，有其标准的发音。这个发音就是 /klæŋ/。

How do YOU pronounce clang? https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/rvw7uz/how_do_you_pronounce_clang/
```console
I know the correct way according to developers is klang, but I just can't help myself, for me it is C-lang. What pronunciation do you personally prefer?
```
- > Definitely ***`klang`***. ***If I said 'C-lang' it's <ins>ambiguous whether I am talking about the C language or the clang compiler</ins>***; that makes no sense to me.
  >> But would you actually ever say "C lang" when talking about the language? Never read or heard that anywhere. I would usually just say "C". If that's too short in some context you probably need a full explanation like "C, the programming language".
  >>> I would if I were doing a google search and C is way too ambiguous. Same with Go/Golang.
  >>>> I wouldn't. Even so, the first thing that pops in my mind if someone says "C lang" is the C language.
  >>>>> Exactly, and that's where I would say C-lang.
- > Well, `clang` is an english word, so I pronounce it as I would normally pronounce the word when I read it in any other context.
- > I pronounce it exactly as it is spelled: "clang".
- > It has an official pronounce klang. from https://web.archive.org/web/20120208050747/http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2008-July/015624.html
- > Klang, like the word for loud noise.
- > The problem with c-lang is that if you put it up next to golang, everyone now thinks you're talking about the language, not a compiler.
- > ~~I pronounce it kleng~~
- > ~~clong~~
- > I prefer to use the pronunciation that Chris Lattner uses; "klang". - https://youtu.be/yCd3CzGSte8?t=417s
