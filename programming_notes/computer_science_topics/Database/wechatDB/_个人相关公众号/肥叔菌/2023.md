PostgreSQL数据库查询执行——Parallel Query https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5lEPog-ex_ZkTW4w5EK2xg
- > PostgreSQL can devise query plans that can leverage multiple CPUs in order to answer queries faster. This feature is known as parallel query. Many queries cannot benefit from parallel query, either due to limitations of the current implementation or because there is no imaginable query plan that is any faster than the serial query plan. However, for queries that can benefit, the speedup from parallel query is often very significant. Many queries can run more than twice as fast when using parallel query, and some queries can run four times faster or even more. Queries that touch a large amount of data but return only a few rows to the user will typically benefit most. This chapter explains some details of how parallel query works and in which situations it can be used so that users who wish to make use of it can understand what to expect. <br> PostgreSQL可以生成利用多个CPU的查询计划，以便更快地执行查询。此功能称为`并行查询`。许多查询无法从并行查询中受益，这可能是由于当前实现的限制，也可能是因为没有比串行查询计划更快的可想象的查询计划。然而，对于可以受益的查询，并行查询的速度通常非常显著。在使用并行查询时，许多查询的运行速度可以提高两倍以上，有些查询的速度可以提高四倍甚至更多。接触大量数据但只向用户返回几行的查询通常会获益最大。本章详细介绍了并行查询的工作原理，以及在哪些情况下可以使用它，以便希望使用它的用户能够了解所需的内容。
- > **How Parallel Query Works**
  * > When the optimizer determines that parallel query is the fastest execution strategy for a particular query, it will create a query plan that includes a Gather or Gather Merge node. Here is a simple example: <br> 当优化器确定并行查询是特定查询的最快执行策略时，它将创建一个包含“聚集”或“聚集合并”节点的查询计划。下面是一个简单的例子：
