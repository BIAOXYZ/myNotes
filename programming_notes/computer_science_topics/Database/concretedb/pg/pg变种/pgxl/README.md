Postgres-XL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgres-XL
> Postgres-XL is based on Postgres-XC, an earlier distributed PostgreSQL system developed by NTT Data and EnterpriseDB. In 2012, the cloud database startup StormDB adopted Postgres-XC and developed some proprietary extensions and improvements to it. In 2013, StormDB was acquired by TransLattice, and the improved software was open-sourced under the name "Postgres-XL" in 2014. Since 2015, Postgres-XL development has also been supported by 2ndQuadrant.
