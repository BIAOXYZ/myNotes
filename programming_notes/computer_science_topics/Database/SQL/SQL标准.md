The History of SQL Standards https://learnsql.com/blog/history-of-sql-standards/
- > **SQL-86**
  * > The first SQL standard was **SQL-86**. It was published in 1986 as ANSI standard and in 1987 as International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard. The starting point for the ISO standard was IBM’s SQL standard implementation. This version of the SQL standard is also known as **SQL 1**.
- > **SQL-92**
  * > The next revision of the standard was **SQL-92** – and it was a major revision. The language introduced by SQL-92 is sometimes referred to as **SQL 2**. The standard document grew ***from `120` to `579` pages***. However, much of the growth was due to more precise specifications of existing features.
- > **SQL:1999**
  * > **SQL:1999** (also called **SQL 3**) was the fourth revision of the SQL standard. Starting with this version, the standard name used a colon instead of a hyphen to be consistent with the names of other ISO standards. This standard was published in multiple installments between 1999 and 2002.

- > SQL-92是SQL数据库查询语言规范的第三次修订。与SQL-89不同的是，此次修订是SQL数据库查询语言标准的一次改动较大的修订。除了一些小细节不兼容之外，SQL-92可以向前兼容SQL-89标准。与SQL-89相比，SQL-92规范内容增长了大约五倍。
