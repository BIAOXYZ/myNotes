```
mongo    #连接mongodb

>show dbs    #查看所有数据库
local 0.078125GB
test 0.203125GB

>use local    #切换到local
switched to db local

> show collections    #查看local的所有collection
startup_log

>db.startup_log.find()    #产看startup_log
{ "_id" : "jlan-pc-1466044795232", "hostname" : "jlan-pc", "startTime",...}

> db.createCollection('startup_log2')    #创建collection
{ "ok" : 1 }

>db.startup_log.remove()    #清空collection

# Dynamo and DynamoDB

Dynamo (storage system) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_(storage_system)
- > Amazon DynamoDB is "built on the principles of Dynamo" and is a hosted service within the AWS infrastructure. However, while Dynamo is based on leaderless replication, DynamoDB uses single-leader replication. 

Amazon DynamoDB https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_DynamoDB
- > Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed proprietary NoSQL database service that supports key-value and document data structures and is offered by Amazon.com as part of the Amazon Web Services portfolio. DynamoDB exposes a similar data model to and derives its name from Dynamo, but has a different underlying implementation. Dynamo had a multi-master design requiring the client to resolve version conflicts and DynamoDB uses synchronous replication across multiple datacenters for high durability and availability. DynamoDB was announced by Amazon CTO Werner Vogels on January 18, 2012 and is presented as an evolution of Amazon SimpleDB solution.

# not full-fledged DBs

Dolt is Git for data! https://github.com/liquidata-inc/dolt
- > Dolt is a relational database, i.e. it has tables, and you can execute SQL queries against those tables. It also has version control primitives that operate at the level of table cell. Thus Dolt is a database that supports fine grained value-wise version control, where all changes to data and schema are stored in commit log.

- > EdgeDB is an open-source object-relational database built on top of PostgreSQL. The goal of EdgeDB is to empower its users to build safe and efficient software with less effort.

BadgerDB https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger
- > BadgerDB is an embeddable, persistent and fast key-value (KV) database written in pure Go. It is the underlying database for [Dgraph](), a fast, distributed graph database. It's meant to be a performant alternative to non-Go-based key-value stores like [RocksDB]().

go-memdb https://github.com/hashicorp/go-memdb
- > Provides the `memdb` package that implements a simple in-memory database built on immutable radix trees. ***The database provides `Atomicity`, `Consistency` and `Isolation` from `ACID`. Being that it is in-memory, it does not provide `durability`***. The database is instantiated with a schema that specifies the tables and indices that exist and allows transactions to be executed.
- > The database provides the following:
  * > Multi-Version Concurrency Control (`MVCC`) - By leveraging immutable radix trees the database is able to support any number of concurrent readers without locking, and allows a writer to make progress.
  * > Transaction Support - The database allows for rich transactions, in which multiple objects are inserted, updated or deleted. The transactions can span multiple tables, and are applied atomically. The database provides `atomicity` and `isolation` in `ACID` terminology, such that until commit the updates are not visible.
  * > Rich Indexing - Tables can support any number of indexes, which can be simple like a single field index, or more advanced compound field indexes. Certain types like UUID can be efficiently compressed from strings into byte indexes for reduced storage requirements.

Hyrise is a research in-memory database. https://github.com/hyrise/hyrise || https://hpi.de/plattner/projects/hyrise.html
- > Hyrise is a research in-memory database system that has been developed [by HPI since 2009](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol4/p105-grund.pdf) and has been entirely [rewritten in 2017](https://openproceedings.org/2019/conf/edbt/EDBT19_paper_152.pdf). Our goal is to provide a clean and flexible platform for research in the area of in-memory data management. Its architecture allows us, our students, and other researchers to conduct experiments around new data management concepts. To enable realistic experiments, Hyrise features comprehensive SQL support and performs powerful query plan optimizations. Well-known benchmarks, such as TPC-H or TPC-DS, can be executed with a single command and without any preparation.

rqlite -- The lightweight, distributed relational database built on SQLite https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite || https://www.philipotoole.com/tag/rqlite/
- > rqlite is an easy-to-use, lightweight, distributed relational database, which uses SQLite as its storage engine. rqlite is simple to deploy, operating it is very straightforward, and its clustering capabilities provide you with fault-tolerance and high-availability. rqlite is available for Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows.
