- > This is the third of a series of four posts based on a presentation I did at the Barcelona Ruby Conference called “20,000 Leagues Under ActiveRecord.” (posts: [one](https://patshaughnessy.net/2014/9/17/20000-leagues-under-activerecord) [two](https://patshaughnessy.net/2014/9/23/how-arel-converts-ruby-queries-into-sql-statements) [four](https://patshaughnessy.net/2014/11/11/discovering-the-computer-science-behind-postgres-indexes) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnLnRPZZ1Q4)).

  * > In the first step, Postgres parses our SQL statement and converts it into a series of C memory structures, a ***`parse tree`***. Next Postgres analyzes and rewrites our query, optimizing and simplifying it using a series of complex algorithms. After that, Postgres generates a ***`plan`*** for finding our data. Like an obsessive compulsive person who won’t leave home without every suitcase packed perfectly, Postgres doesn’t run our query until it has a plan. Finally, Postgres actually executes our query. In this presentation I’ll briefly touch on the first three topics, and then focus more on the last step: Execute.
