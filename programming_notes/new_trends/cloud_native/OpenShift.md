- "**`OpenShift Container Platform`** (formerly known as **`OpenShift Enterprise`**) is Red Hat's on-premises private platform as a service product, built around a core of application containers powered by Docker, with orchestration and management provided by Kubernetes, on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux."
- "**`OpenShift Origin`**, also known since August 2018 as **`OKD`** (Origin Community Distribution) is the upstream community project used in OpenShift Online, OpenShift Dedicated, and OpenShift Container Platform."
- "**`Red Hat OpenShift Online (RHOO)`** is Red Hat's public cloud application development and hosting service which runs on AWS."
- "**`OpenShift Dedicated`** is Red Hat's managed private cluster offering, built around a core of application containers powered by Docker, with orchestration and management provided by Kubernetes, on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It is available on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) since December 2016 marketplaces."
- "**`OpenShift.io`** is Red Hat's SaaS service that provides an application development environment."
