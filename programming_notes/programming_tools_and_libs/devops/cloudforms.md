# 和ManageIQ的关系

>> notes：简单总结下就是ManageIQ也是创业公司，后来RH收购了这个产品，基于这个产品自己搞了CloudForms，然后把ManageIQ开源了。下面那个linkedin是创始人。

ManageIQ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ManageIQ
> ManageIQ is an open source cloud management platform. It was founded by Red Hat as a community project in 2014, and forms the basis for its CloudForms product.
