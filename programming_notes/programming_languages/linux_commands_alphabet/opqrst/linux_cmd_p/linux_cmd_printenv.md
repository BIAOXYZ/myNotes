What is the difference between 'env' and 'printenv'? https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/123473/what-is-the-difference-between-env-and-printenv

  * > There was, just history manner.
    ```console
    1. Bill Joy wrote the first version of printenv command in 1979 for BSD.
    2. UNIX System III introduced env command in 1980.
    3. GNU followed UNIX System's env in 1986.
    4. BSD followed GNU/UNIX System's env in 1988.
    5. MINIX followed BSD's printenv in 1988.
    6. GNU followed MINX/BSD's printenv in 1989.
    7. GNU shell programming utilities 1.0 included printenv and env in 1991.
    8. GNU Shell Utilities merged into GNU coreutils in 2002, which is what you find in GNU/Linux nowadays.
    ```
  * > Note that the "followed" doesn't means the source code was the same, probably they were rewritten to avoid license lawsuits.
  * > So, the reason why both commands existed is because Bill Joy wrote `printenv` even before `env` existed. After 10 years of merging/compatibility and GNU come across it, you are now seeing both similar commands on the same page.
