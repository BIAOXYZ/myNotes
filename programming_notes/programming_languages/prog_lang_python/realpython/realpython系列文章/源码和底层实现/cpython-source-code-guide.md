  * > When you type python at the console or install a Python distribution from python.org, you are running **`CPython`**. CPython is one of the many Python runtimes, maintained and written by different teams of developers. Some other runtimes you may have heard are [`PyPy`](https://pypy.org/), [`Cython`](https://cython.org/), and [`Jython`](https://www.jython.org/).
    >> //notes：Cython 都是另外一种语言了吧，不止是一种 Python 运行时了。
