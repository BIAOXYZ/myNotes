  * > **Parallelism** consists of performing multiple operations at the same time. **Multiprocessing** is a means to effect parallelism, and it entails spreading tasks over a computer’s central processing units (CPUs, or cores). ***<ins>Multiprocessing is well-suited for CPU-bound tasks: tightly bound [for loops](https://realpython.com/python-for-loop/) and mathematical computations usually fall into this category<ins>***.
