Python nonlocal statement https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1261875/python-nonlocal-statement
- > Compare this, without using `nonlocal`:
  ```py
  x = 0
  def outer():
      x = 1
      def inner():
          x = 2
          print("inner:", x)

      inner()
      print("outer:", x)

  outer()
  print("global:", x)

  # inner: 2
  # outer: 1
  # global: 0
  ```
- > To this, using `nonlocal`, where `inner()`'s `x` is now also `outer()`'s `x`:
  ```py
  x = 0
  def outer():
      x = 1
      def inner():
          nonlocal x
          x = 2
          print("inner:", x)

      inner()
      print("outer:", x)

  outer()
  print("global:", x)

  # inner: 2
  # outer: 2
  # global: 0
  ```
- > If we were to use `global`, it would bind `x` to the properly "global" value:
  ```py
  x = 0
  def outer():
      x = 1
      def inner():
          global x
          x = 2
          print("inner:", x)

      inner()
      print("outer:", x)

  outer()
  print("global:", x)

  # inner: 2
  # outer: 1
  # global: 2
  ```
