pybind11 — Seamless operability between C++11 and Python https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
- > **pybind11** is a lightweight ***header-only*** library that ***exposes C++ types in Python and vice versa***, mainly to ***create Python bindings of existing C++ code***. Its ***goals and syntax are similar to*** the excellent [Boost.Python](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/python/doc/) library by David Abrahams: to minimize boilerplate code in traditional extension modules by inferring type information using compile-time introspection.
