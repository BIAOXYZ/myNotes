Why isn't 'nullptr' in the 'std' namespace? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21510121/why-isnt-nullptr-in-the-std-namespace
- > `nullptr` is a C++11 keyword (no different to `if`, `public`, `true`, `void`, etc.), so namespaces don't apply.
- > `nullptr` is a pointer literal the same way as for example `true` is a boolean literal. This literal has type `std::nullptr_t` that is as you see this type is defined in name space `std::`. The pointer literal is described in section 2.14.7 Pointer literals of the C++ Standard.
