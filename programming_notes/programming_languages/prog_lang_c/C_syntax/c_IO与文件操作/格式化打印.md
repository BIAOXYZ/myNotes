  * > The `printf()` family of functions uses `%` character as a placeholder. When a `%` is encountered, `printf` reads the characters following the `%` to determine what to do:
    ```console
    %s - Take the next argument and print it as a string
    %d - Take the next argument and print it as an int
    ```
  * > See this Wikipedia article for a nice picture: [printf format string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string)
  * > The `\n` at the end of the string is for a newline/carriage-return character.
