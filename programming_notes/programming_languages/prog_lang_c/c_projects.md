Containers https://github.com/bkthomps/Containers
- > This library provides various containers. Each container has utility functions to manipulate the data it holds. This is an abstraction as to not have to manually manage and reallocate memory. <br> Inspired by the C++ standard library; however, implemented using C with different function interfaces as the C++ standard library but with the same container names.

C Macro Collections https://github.com/LeoVen/C-Macro-Collections
- > No installation is required. The entire library is made of header files and can be directly included into your project.
