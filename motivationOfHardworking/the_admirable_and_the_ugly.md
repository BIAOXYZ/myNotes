# Preface

The title comes from here: 
> Information Security Journals - The good, the bad, and the ugly https://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~stamp/securityJournals.html

The original intention is just a document like "Which projects I would most likely contribute?". However, things always change. So the worth fucking should at least be recorded here.
